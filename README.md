A simple python HTTP-Proxy Server. once the program is started using "python proxy.py #" where # is a number, it listens in on port 8888,
we can search some sites that were given to us from my university:

http://localhost:8888/www.cs.toronto.edu/~ylzhang/ (with CSS and Javascript)
http://localhost:8888/www.cs.toronto.edu/~arnold/ (a giant HTML to re-
ceive. Thanks, Arnold!)
http://localhost:8888/www.cs.toronto.edu/~ylzhang/csc258/memes.html (one
with many images)
